* About

  ASynK - Awesome Sync (by Karra), is a flexible PIM synchronization platform
  written in Python. ASynK was earlier known as Gout. High level features
  include:

  - ASynK allows two-way sync of Contacts across any two supported sources -
    Google Contacts, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Exchange Server, any CardDAV
    server and Emacs BBDB.
  
  - ASynK is the only two-way synchronization option for BBDB known to be in
    existence today. So if you are keen to keep your BBDB content synchronized
    with a mobile device or Outlook, look no further.
  
  - ASynK works on Windows, MacOS X, and Linux. Outlook synchronization
    only works on Windows.
  
  - Synchronization is granular to the level of 'Folders', i.e. you can
    synchronize one folder of Google Contacts with a Outlook folder (on
    Windows at work, say), and another Google folder in the same account with
    BBDB (On your Mac, say)
  
  - The infrastructure is there to add more database and item types
    (i.e. tasks, notes, etc.), but currently only Contacts synchronization for
    Google Contacts, BBDB and Outlook supported
    
  - It is free software, and released under the GNU AGPL (Affero GPL) version

* Installation & Usage

As you are reading this file, the most efficient installation is to clone this
git repository to your machine. Then see the section titled Usage below to 
invoke ASynK.

** Dependencies

   - You need Python (tested with 2.7, try earlier versions at your
     discretion; may not work with Python 3)

   - The following python packages:

     - tornado
     - requests

   - If you wish to sync to Outlook you can do that only on Windows. Further
     you will need MS Outlook installed, along with a third party python
     library called Pywin32 from Mark Hammond

   - On Debian (and likely Ubuntu) you will need the following packages:
        sudo apt-get install python-argparse

   - The dateutil package available from http://labix.org/python-dateutil or
     https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-dateutil

** Usage

   The recommended way to use ASynK is to first create your own 'sync profile'
   which specifies which folders and PIM DBs you want to keep in sync. Refer
   to the documentation for more details.

   For the really impatient, ASynK comes with two default sync profiles that
   kick in if no other profile is configured.
   
   $ python asynk.py --op=sync [--dry-run] [--log=debug]

   If you run the above command on Windows, the entire default outlook
   contacts folder will get synched to "My Contacts" on Google Contacts. (You
   will be prompted for your google username and password). 

   On any non-windows platform your ~/.bbdb will be synced to google.

   For further usage help, try "python asynk.py -h"
