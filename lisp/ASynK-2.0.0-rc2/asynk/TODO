* TODO

** Bugs

*** ol.prep_contact_lists() only works on startup

If we invoke this routine once, do some operation and then invoke it
again, we only get zero stats. This potentially exists for the gc
version as well.

*** need to store both the self link and edit link

Both of these are needed for different activities. This needs to be
done once we are pretty sure about the changes and we can take a
branch out to experiment this.

** Features

*** BBDB Support

    As of April 2012, significant rewrite has happened on the f_tasks branch
    setting the ground for supporting BBDB as a third database
    provider. Interesting times lie ahead.

*** Support more than one message store

    We need to iterate and grab all the message store contents
    
    There could be more than one message store in the default Outlook
    Profile. Need to be able to look into all of them for contact items.

    some preliminary support is now implemented. Not really user visible.

* Done

** Sync tag is lost on OL side aftear a mod update from GC

    Tue Apr 03 19:02:43 IST 2012

    There is a problem in the way we blow up all the props and then
    repopulate. In this approach the original synctag is lost... This needs to
    be fixed, and as of now this is the only known bug with the sync logic.

** Support more contact fields to be uploaded

    More contact fields need to get synched, including: 

    - IM ... done


** Many key changes related to Gmail -> OL are missing

    Thu Aug 25 18:04:31  2011

    All the confusion related to the return of the TechM laptop has
    appeared to have resulted in some 'bit rot' after all.

    I just noticed today that the version on github is missing 2 key
    pieces of the sync puzzle -> sync new gmail contacts to Outlook
    and also sync modified gmail contacts to Outlook. These changes
    are nowhere to be found - definitely not on the Transend. It was a
    lot of code changeand as I remember it, was even working quite
    well... It's a severe setback.

    Approach now is to continue making the fixes to other parts of the
    code base, and hope either the MacBook or the Scorpio will have
    it, and in good shape. That is the hope.

    Updated: Mon Oct 17 12:16:45 IST 2011

    after searching far and wide I have given up on this thing, and have
    implemented most of the stuff again. Life has to move on.

** Contact.fields keeps growing in size

    With every Contact object the number of fields in the array
    appears to keep growing by 4. 

    Fixed: Commit c52fd0475b6

** Track contacts that are uploaded

Completed: Tue Jul 12 18:43:20  2011

Store the ID of the newly created entry and store it in some user
defined field in Outlook.

** Refactor to make contacts.py more object oriented

The code is a mess overall. Should really have MapiMsgStore,
MapiFolder, Message etc. type wrapper objects. It is not a pretty
sight at the moment

** Upate fields

*** Address Upload

   The postal address information is not getting uploaded properly. There is
   no problem in reading it from the Outlook addressbook. There is some
   problem in uploading it with the right schema

   Fixed: 2ecb408dcd

** The outlook time stamp is in UTC

When comparind timestamps, the outlook last modified time we get is in
UTC, but without a timezone notifier. We need to get the time zones
normalized before comparison.

Fixed in ol_wrapper.py:prep_lists

** Sync "Other" phone details

number marked as Other is not getting synched to google.

** Sync Logic outline

  - for each contact in outlook with gc_id:
  
    -- present -is he on gmail?
    -- if not present 

       --- if google says fellow has been deleted:
       	   -- delete from outlook
       --- else:
       	   -- should not really happen, but we could create a new
       	   -- contact on google and reset the gc_id in outlook

    -- else (contact present):

       --- if neither updated since last sync: we are done w/this chap

       --- if only updtate on outlook side since last sync, sync
           across to google

       --- if only update on gmail side since last sync, sync across
           to outlook

       --- if both sides have been updated since last sync:

           --- resolve direction based on config parameter
           --- sync accordingly

  - for each contact in gmail created since last sync:
    -- copy them to outlook


  - might require some local store of all outlook coctact entryids to
    be able to figure out deletes in outlook to be reflected properly
    in gmail. this we will keep for later.
