##
## This Makefile automates some of the steps in the release
## process. Ideally we want to automate all of the following setps
## based on a version string, which is also used to tag the source repo
##
##  1. Change the version string in asynk.py, which is used in --version output
##
##  2. Commit the above change
##
##  3. Tag the source with the version number
##
##  4. Clone the current repo into a temporary repository
##
##  5. cd to the repository and build the documentation
##
##  6. Zip up the repository into .zip and .tar.gz archives
##
##  7. Upload the archives to github downloads section
## 
##  8. Edit the announcements in gae/index.html, and update the
##     timestamp for the page in the footer.
##
##  9. Push the updates to gae
##
## 10. Change the version with a '+' added to the version string.
##
## 11. Commit the changes
##
## 12. Push changes to upstream git repo
##
## The steps that involve pushing things to github and gae will come
## under the 'install' target. The rest will come under the default
## target. There is nothing to clean up at this stage.
