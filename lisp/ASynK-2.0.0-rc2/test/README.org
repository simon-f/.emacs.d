This directory contains random test and exploration code that can be used to activate and test specific areas of the code base in isolation. In particular the "gold/" directory is meant to be the full unit test suite that every change should pass before commit. This directory, otoh, is to do some probing (like print a given outlook entry, or clear specific flags, or some such one time operation in a debug cycle).
